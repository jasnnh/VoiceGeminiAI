# VoiceGeminiAI
C++ Project in Unity Engine using an offline voice recognition library to convert voice talk to text and send that text to Google Gemini AI as a prompt using HTTP Request
The AI.php script is the script communicating to Gemini AI and forwarding the response back to the application.

I have used this same tech in a horror game where you can talk to the AI ghost
